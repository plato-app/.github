# Come for the Games, Stay for the People

## 🎲 Plato’s Story

In the early days of the Internet, our founders created the original Yahoo! Games and grew it to be the largest online games portal of its day. It was amazingly gratifying to witness so many people around the world playing games and connecting on such a large scale.

In 2014, we re-formed as Plato with the same DNA to continue the same mission - bringing people closer together through great games.

Fast forward to today, we are humbled that millions of players are enjoying our games and creating lasting friendships daily on Plato.

## 📜 Our Philosophy

### Games that connect

We firmly believe that games 
are the social glue that can bring people together. Everything we do at Plato is done to make that happen as open and as seamlessly as possible.

### Pure gaming experience

We've been creating games since the 90s and we're saddened to see the proliferation of predatory gimmicks in the industry. In response, we keep our games pure by avoiding any "pay-to-win" monetization methods.

### Respect players

We appreciate that we would not exist without our community. In addition to not polluting the product with "pay-to-win" gimmicks, we've also committed to removing all ads and unnecessary tracking from Plato.

### Milliseconds matter
